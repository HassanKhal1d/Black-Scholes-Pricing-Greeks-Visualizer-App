# Black-Scholes-Pricing-Greeks-Visualizer-App
An interactive options pricing web app that uses the Black-Scholes Model to calculate and visualize European Call and Put option prices. Built using Python and Streamlit, the app includes dynamic heatmaps, a Greeks visualizer, and a structured interpretation guide.


# Overview

This application allows users to:
Calculate European Call and Put option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.
Visualize the option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho).
Display heatmaps of option prices across spot prices and volatilities.
Toggle between Call and Put views for both pricing and Greeks.
Interpret behavior across volatility regimes through a structured table.
View a clean summary of model parameters and computed results.
